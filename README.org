This crate provides a trait to read data asynchronously without removing it from the queue (like
when using the blocking methods [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.peek][~std::net::TcpStream::peek()~]] and [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html#method.peek][~std::net::UdpSocket::peek()~]]).
